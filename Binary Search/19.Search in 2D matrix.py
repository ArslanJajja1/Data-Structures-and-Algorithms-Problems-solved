# You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

# Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
# The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
# Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.

# You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
# Output: true
# Example 2:


# Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
# Output: false
 

# Constraints:

# m == matrix.length
# n == matrix[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 100
# -104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104
